# sai
**sai** is a general purpose C++ library designed for usability. **sai** is written to be immediately useful and usable, and tries to not put a burden on the programmers using it.
**sai** does not require a *buy in*, in that unlike other libraries or frameworks like Qt or .NET, it tries
not to have interdependecies between its parts as much as it is technically feasible. Each module from **sai** is designed to be used and usable on its own, each is meant to be its own beautiful snowflake.

**sai** is being written with the beliefs that writting C++ code can be as productive, and as easy to write and as beatiful as C#, Python, or other high level programming languages, famous for their productivity. I believe that that productivity comes from the rich libraries available to those languages, and **sai** is an experiment towards that end.
I strongly belive that with the right, or more precisely, with a rich set of libraries that follow a consistent style, we can have productivity that rivals
that of the programming languages mentioned before.
I absolutely love C++, and I love being able to write more of it, in all sort of cases. I believe C++ should not be the language that we have to resort to
only when we need to write high performance code or when we need to maintain legacy code, whose authors often question their choices. C++ is a modern languages, C++ is evolving 
more than ever.

There are a lot of libraries for C++ out there, there is even a larger number of C libraries, that can be used directly from C++.
I think it's kind of sad that they all follow different styles and have different designs, and serve different purposes.
Each trying to introduce the same concept, or thing again, and again, for different reasons, or reinventing the wheel, because it's missing from the standard library. **sai** tries to provide a comprehensive and rich set of libraries, for everyone.

The name **sai** is a word play of the word "say", or "saying", which means we say, or express what we want to do, and the machine does it for us.
